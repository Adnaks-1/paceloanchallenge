## Example Output

**Subject Line:** Energy Savings for Heritage Community Bank Properties

**Email Body:**
Hi Stewart,

As Head of Commercial Real Estate Lending at Heritage Community Bank, you likely see countless financing structures for property improvements. I wanted to introduce you to one that's gaining significant traction in Colorado's commercial market.

C-PACE financing allows property owners to fund energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades with no money down, repaid through a property tax assessment over 15-25 years. For banks like Heritage, it's also becoming a valuable tool to offer clients alongside traditional lending.

Would you be open to a brief call to explore how C-PACE might complement your commercial real estate portfolio?

Best regards,
[Sales Rep Name]
Pace Loan Group

**Notes for Sales Rep:** Stewart's title suggests he may be interested both for the bank's own properties AND as a financing product to offer clients. Consider both angles in follow-up.
